Demonstrates how to implement a basic web analytics tracker using Google App Engine's Data Store on the server-side.

Note About the Login
--------------------

The password to view the statistics is "apple" (without the quotation marks). This is a constant in the 'main.py' script.

Since security wasn't the focus of this demo, the password entered to view the statistics is stored in a cookie without any encoding. This shouldn't be done in a real-world web application.
