htmldemos
=========

A bunch of random demos that demonstrate different capabilities of HTML5.

animated-gallery
----------------

Demonstrates how to create a simple CSS3 gallery using WebKit animations for live filtering, simulating the behavior of the native NSCollectionView and IKImageBrowserView classes on Mac OS X. For best results use Safari, which leverages GPU acceleration when animating the -webkit-transform property. Watch a [video](http://vimeo.com/13605436) of it in action!

ipodvideo
---------

Embeds a live HTML5 video element inside the screen of an iPod classic. The buttons on the iPod's click-wheel work as expected.

mailer
------

Uses Google App Engine on the server-side and HTML5 technologies on the client side to display a rich, interactive feedback form that looks like a postcard.

stalker
-------

Demonstrates how to implement a basic web analytics tracker using Google App Engine's Data Store on the server-side.
