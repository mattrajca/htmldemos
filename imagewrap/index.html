                <li>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.</li>
                <li>The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</li>
                <li>They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.</li>
                <li>You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.</li>
                <li>About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things.</li>
                <li>They push the human race forward.</li>
                <li>And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</li>
                <li>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</li>
